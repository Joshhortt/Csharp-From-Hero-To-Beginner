THE SLY FOX

e Fox was walking on the road and found a stick. He picked it up and went on. He reached a village and knocked on someone's door:

- Knock - knock-knock!

- Who is it? - someone asked.

- It's me - the Sly Fox. Let me spend the night at your house.

- There isn't enough space. There isn't enough space for us anyway!

- I won't cause you inconvenience. I will lie down on the plank-bed, my tail will be under the plank-bed, and my stick will be under the stove.

They pitied him and let him in.

The Fox lay down on the plank-bed, his tail - under the plank-bed, and his stick - under the stove. During the night, the Sly Fox got up and burnt his stick, and in the morning he started yelling.

- Where is my stick? I want my stick back! I won't leave without it. Only a hen can replace my stick.

The owner was startled. He thought and thought, and after all what to do - he gave him a hen. The Fox took the hen and while walking on the road sang:

The Fox was walking on the road,

and found a stick

and in exchange of it

the Sly Fox got a hen.
