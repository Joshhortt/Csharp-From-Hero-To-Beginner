1. Challenge 

Console.WriteLine() is to print a line with variable input to the console.  
Console.Write() does perform the exact same task but without a newline appended to the end.

We can also format the text of a string a little by including right and left justification. 

 For example:

Console.WriteLine("*{0,10}*", "Bill");
will print the string "Bill" between two stars but "Bill" will take up 10 spaces and be right aligned like this:

*      Bill*
If you want to left align the string in 10 spaces then the second part of the format must be a negative thus:

Console.WriteLine("*{0,-10}*", "Bill");
Given this new information, your challenge is to write a program to ask the user to enter their name,
job title and company name and then to print out a name badge that looks like this:

|**********************|
|Name:             Josh|
|            Programmer|
|----------------------|
|            	     C#|
