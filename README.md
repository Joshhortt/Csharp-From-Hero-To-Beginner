## This is Your First Step to Become a Programmer

_"Learning to Programm is one of the best decisions you made"._<br/>
_If you decided to start with C# congratulations._<br/> 

_Today you can use C# for all types of applications from controlling robots and writing web apps to developing games and analysing data._<br/>
_It runs on Windows and Mac in a variety of software including Visual Studio and the Unity Games Engine and so on._<br/>

_Though when you are learning to code for the very first time, when things go wrong, you can't be sure if it is you or the software._<br/>
_Doing away with all the bling leaves very little to troubleshoot when its just you, the code and the computer._<br/>

_In this course we strip all the fancy interfaces away to focus purely on programming._<br/>
_Whether you are a Windows or a Mac person this course caters for all by using the any Text Editor and the Mono C# compiler._<br/>

_We will be learning the fundamental programming concepts that exist in all coding languages._<br/> 
_When you have these under your belt you can be assured that switching between languages will become second nature._<br/>

_I don't promise that you will come out of this course a programmer.  In fact you won't._<br/> 
_It takes at least many years of practice to get to that stage._<br/>  
_But if you are keen and committed the fundamentals you pick up in this course will take you far with programming into the future._<br/>

_I would like to invite you to learn programming in C# following this amazing course._<br/>
_Ignite your passion for finding little miracles in code every day._<br/>
_When you have these concepts locked down then it will be time to pick up the pretty tools and start creating._
